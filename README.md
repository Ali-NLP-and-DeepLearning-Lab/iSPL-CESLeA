This is a repository for ISPL's turnkey project on Behavioral Prediction (인식예측). We use IMU sensor data collected from standalone sensor devices, smartphones, smartwatches and other on-body gadgets to learn a user's behaviour and predict their patterns.

This project is currently under development.
